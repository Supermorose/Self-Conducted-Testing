        <br>
        <p>If you couldn't tell, I like anime.</p>
        <h3>A few thoughts...</h3>
        <p>There's nothing particularly interesting about this website right now. I'll probably wind up making this into a personal website or something, but this is placeholder text mostly.</p>
        <P>I've really been into hardcore and metalcore music as of the last few years. I don't remember where exactly this appreciation of the genre came from, but I do remember my sophomore year of college someone showed me a couple of songs from Power Trip and I just went from there. My first real hardcore show was attending the Observatory date of Turnstile's <em>Time & Space</em> tour. They played with Touche Amore, who I was already a really big fan of, and Culture Abuse who I was not as familiar with. It's a shame about Culture Abuse's vocalist, but they put on a good show and they had a few songs I ended up enjoying a bit. Also Razorbumps played that show. I actually enjoyed them a lot but it doesn't seem like they got up to a lot since the relase of their Hellrazors album. I guess maybe the vocalist maybe found herself interested in other things outside of playing music. Anyways, I'm going off on a tangent, so back to what I was saying.</P>
        <p>I've developed a lot of my primary interests over the last few years, and I think that the kind of music that I enjoy helped to shape a large portion of that. Without having listening to bands like Turnstile and Power Trip, I wouldn't have wound up listening to bands like Vamachara, WristMeetRazor, Cold World, and that kind of stuff. Getting deeper into that kind of music is what led me to getting into collecting vintage merchandise. There's something that I find really fulfilling about just building a collection of items for bands that I like listening to, and I find it more rewarding when it's not easy to get these things. I've also made some really great friends from the whole thing. I've met people like Alfredo, Vaughn, Dakota, Michael, Ben, Peter, Jakob, Magnus, Jay, and Zack and that's not somthing I take for granted. They're all really great people for the most part and they share the same niche and kind of weird interests that I do.</p>

        <h3>Some artists I've been enjoying recently</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href ="https://fleshwater.bandcamp.com/">Fleshwater</a></dt>
                <dd>A sort of side project from the guys in Vein. It definitely has a different sound to it, and it's not comparable to the things Vein did on Errorzone, but I think it's pretty enjoyable as a departure from what Vein is.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvknOXGPzCQ">Deftones</a></dt>
                <dd>There's not much to say if you know who the Deftones are. They've been around since forever and picked up some steam from their online resurgence and it seems a lot of teenagers realized they like this band. It's hard not to considering how influential their sound has been and some of their phenomenal songs like 'Be Quiet and Drive', 'Feiticeira', 'Digital Bath', 'Koi no Yokan', 'Rosemary', and the like. Fantastic band I've always been a fan of.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://lovedbyadrienne.bandcamp.com/album/adrienne">Adrienne</a></dt>
                <dd>This is my friend Alfredo's band, and they're based out of Massachussetts. They're heavily inspired by the Gothenburg style of metalcore and hardocre from the early '00s and the late 90s. I think they're great and I love supporting my friends.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://razel.bandcamp.com/releases">Razel Got Her Wings</a></dt>
                <dd>This is another band that consists of people I'm friends with (Vaughn, Dakota, Ben, Dalton). Another one that is inspired by some of the same influences that Adrienne takes from, but has their own sound as well. I'm excited for their new full length record to come out this following year!</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://coldworldband.bandcamp.com/">Cold World</a></dt>
                <dd>Cold World are a modern staple of the hardcore foundation. Not liking this band is almost like treason to any real hardcore fan. They blend hardcore with rap and streetwear in a way that not a lot of bands did when they first started picking up traction. Dedicated to Babies Who Came Feet First is an incredible album with some of the band's best material.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dDOHZcpAZg">7 Angels 7 Plagues</a></dt>
                <dd>One of Matthew Mattera's bands, I think that 7 Angels 7 Plagues is probably his most important band in terms of the impact that they've had upon the genre. Most modern bands will cite Jhazmyne's Lullaby as one of the records that influenced their sound. It's really hard to overstate just how fantastic this band is.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://vacationsfanclub.bandcamp.com/">Vacations</a></dt>
                <dd>Vacations is a departure from the other artists so far on this list. They're an indie band out of Australia that my girlfriend showed me and I've been in love with them ever since. They've also gained a significant following from their TikTok exposure which I'm happy to see. I think the best way I can really describe the sound Vacations has is like if the guitarwork of Mac DeMarco met the vocals you could hear on an Inner Wave song.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://ckyalliance.bandcamp.com/music">Camp Kill Yourself</a></dt>
                <dd>I originally heard of CKY because they had a sort of affiliation with Bam Margera, since he would always be sporting their gear in the early days of Jackass and Viva la Bam content. This band rips and although I'm not a super fan their songs I do like are really just powerhouse songs. Listen to 'Flesh Into Gear' or '96 Quite Bitter Beings'.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI55Q8gFIkg">The Flaming Lips</a></dt>
                <dd>If I'm not mistaken, this is a band I got into because of my AP Lit teacher in high school; Mr. Kirchner. I went and bought The Soft Bulletin on CD shortly after he showed me their music, but it turns out I love Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots alot more as a whole. That album is simply incredible, and 'In the Morning of the Magicians' is one of my favorite songs that I've heard in a long time.</dd>
            <dt><a href="https://neverendinggame.bandcamp.com/releases">Never Ending Game</a></dt>
                <dd>Returning to the thematics of hardcore, Never Ending Game is my current candidate for best modern hardcore band. I think there are only a few songs at most from this band that I have not thought are completely insanely high quality. Everything from their demos, to their full lengths has been excellent. I also really like the merch that they put out, and I always make sure to grab something whenever I can. These guys can do no wrong in my eyes and I'm excited for whatever they release next.</dd>
